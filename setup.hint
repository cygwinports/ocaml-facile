ldesc: "FaCiLe is a constraint programming library on integer and 
integer set finite domains written in OCaml. It offers all usual 
facilities to create and manipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic 
expressions and constraints (possibly non-linear), built-in global 
constraints (difference, cardinality, sorting etc.) and search and 
optimization goals."
